# Azure Table Storage example

A minimal example project showing how to work with Azure Table Storage in a node.js project.

Don't pay attention to the shopping list files.

If you want to get it running, you need to aquire an Azure Table Storage account first. Then create a file called config.json in the root of your project with the following content:

    {
        "azAccountName": "put-the-name-of-your-storage-here",
        "azAccountKey": "put-the-key-for-the-account-here"
    }

That's it.
